  Application definition for temperature-dependent IV curve measurements.
  
  In this application definition, times should be specified always together
  with an UTC offset.
  
  This is the application definition describing temperature dependent IV curve
  measurements. For this a temperature is set. After reaching the temperature,
  a voltage sweep is performed. For each voltage a current is measured.
  Then, the next desired temperature is set and an IV measurement is performed.

        There should also be two more fields called temperature and voltage containing the setpoint values.
        There should also be a field with an array of rank equal to the number of different temperature setpoints and each child's dimension
        equal to the number of voltage setpoints.

 # Scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS)
[STS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scanning_tunneling_spectroscopy) was developed following the invention of the scanning tunneling microscope (STM) to probe surface electronic structure. Employing a sharp tip on a substrate, current (I) curves are measured without scanning, usually as a function of voltage (Bias Spectroscopy, I vs V or simply I/V curves) [G. Binnig et al. in Physical Review Letters](https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.55.991). A correct measurement of such curves enables the intepretation of the material's bulk or interfacial electronic and vibrational structure. Additionally, curves can be recorded per x,y pixel leading to a I/V, dI/dV and d<sup>2</sup>I/dV<sup>2</sup> mapping or microscopy [R. J. Hamers et.al. in Physical Review Letters](https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.56.1972). 

## Spectroscopy type: Bias Spectroscopy (Out of several types)
## I/V, dI/dV and d<sup>2</sup>I/dV<sup>2</sup> curves
Today, I/V curves are recored by means of a phase senstive detection device, such as a lock-in amplifier. Depending on the correct usage of the lock-in amplifier, this enables the user to approximatelly measure the dI/dV and d<sup>2</sup>I/dV<sup>2</sup> data as output of the lock-in amplifier instead of nummerically deriving I/V. 

The following are the parameter set involved in STS. Most parameters are recorded during measurment employing the SPECS Group GmbH Nanonis BP5e (not in the order read by the BP5e software)

### Spectroscopy resolution (literature reference or dynamic reference) # Application definition? Min. requirements? 
### (What are the relations between parameters?) Which technical component does the it parameterise? 

- Temperature 1>Temperature 1 (K)	4.92997E+0	# Temperature of STM head.
- Temperature 2>Temperature 2 (K)	-	# Temperature of bottom of LHe helium cryostat. 
- Temperature 3>Temperature 3 (K)	-	# Temperature of LN2 nitrogen shield. 
- Lock-in>Modulated signal	Bias (V)	1E-3 # Applied modulation to the bias voltage.

- Integration time (s)	150E-6 # Time during which the *Bias spectroscopy* data are acquired and averaged.
- Bias Spectroscopy>Number of sweeps	100	 # Number of *Bias spectroscopy* sweeps to measure and average.
- Bias Spectroscopy>Sweep Start (V)	-300E-3  # The first bias of the *Bias spectroscopy* values of the sweep.	
- Bias Spectroscopy>Sweep End (V)	300E-3	 # The last bias values of the sweep.
- Bias Spectroscopy>Num Pixel	4096	# Define the sweep number of points *(related to size of the file)*, that is, the maximum spectrum resolution eq. Bias window divide by Num Pixel. 
- Bias Spectroscopy>Z Avg time (s)	100E-3 # Duration over which the Z position is recorded and averaged before and after the sweep (the latter only if Record final Z position is selected in the Advanced section). After the initial Z averaging time, if Z-Controller to Hold is selected in the Advanced section, the Z-Controller is set to hold and the tip is placed at the previously averaged Z position (plus Z offset).

- SoftwareMain>RT Frequency (Hz)	20E+3	# The bandwitdh of the Hardware and/or Software
- SoftwareMain>Signals Oversampling	10	# (Signals Periods) The Signals Period is the rate at which the signals are transferred to the host computer running the control software. This is usually lower by a factor of 10 than the sampling rate, because an internal oversampling of the signal is done on the real time engine. You can reduce the oversampling down to 1 in order to resolve higher frequencies in the Spectrum Analyzer.
- SoftwareMain>Acquisition Period (s)	20E-3	# Update rate for several processes like History Graph, Auto-Approach, and for many Programming Interface functions. This is usually set to 20 ms. All additional timings (7-9) can only be integer multiples of this value. They can be set to different values, but the actual timing value will be coerced to a multiple of the Acquisition Period.
- SoftwareMain>Animations Period (s)	20E-3	# Update rate of animated graphical indicators. These are e.g. some graphs & sliders. A reasonable value is 40 ms (25 updates per second). Increase this period to reduce the processor load for the graphical user interface, especially on slow computers. This value is purely a user interface update rate and does not affect measurements in any way.
- SoftwareMain>Indicators Period (s)	300E-3	 # Update rate of digital indicators, e.g. the numbers displayed besides each slider. Here, 3 updates per second, or 300 ms is enough. This value is purely a user interface update rate and does not affect measurements in any way.
- SoftwareMain>Measurements Period (s)	500E-3	# The Measurements period is the integration time for precise measurements (averaging over specified period), mostly used in sweep modules. Examples are recording of a force-distance curve or a resonance of a cantilever. For fast measurements with small steps, a value of 40 ms may be reasonable. For normal use, 300-500 ms is a good value, but for recording a resonance of a high-Q cantilever, values of several seconds might be necessary. Usually this parameter doesn’t need to be set from this module; the sweep modules will set this value according to the sweep timings.

- Z-Controller>Switch off delay (s)	0E+0  #  Use this parameter for a reproducible position when switching off the Z-controller. When >0 and the Z-controller is switched off, it doesn't switch off immediately but continues to run for the specified time and averages the Z position.

- Bias Spectroscopy>Channels	Current (A);LI Demod 2 X (A);LI Demod 2 Y (A);LI Demod 1 X (A);LI Demod 1 Y (A)  #  Select the channels to record.
- Bias Spectroscopy>Reset Bias	TRUE  #  When selected, the Bias voltage returns to the initial value (before starting the sweep) at the end of the spectroscopy measurement (default). When not selected, Bias remains at the last value of the sweep. This is useful e.g. when combining several sweep segments. Example for an automated measurement (using Programming Interface): switch off Z-Controller, start spectroscopy sweep segments (only fwd sweep, no reset bias), set bias back to initial value, switch on Z-Controller.
- Bias Spectroscopy>Record final Z	FALSE  #  Select whether to record the Z position during Z averaging time at the end of the sweep (after Z control time) and store the average value in the header of the file when saving. Using this option increases the sweep time by Z averaging time.
- Bias Spectroscopy>Lock-In run	FALSE  #  Select whether to set the Lock-In to run during the measurement. When using this feature, make sure the Lock-In is configured correctly and settling times are set to twice the Lock-In period at least. This option is ignored when Lock-In is already running. This option is disabled if the Sweep Mode is MLS and the flag to configure the Lock-In per segment in the Multiline segment editor is set.
- Lock-in>Lock-in status	ON  #  ON/OFF of Lock-in amplifier
- Lock-in>Modulated signal	Bias (V)  #  This is the signal on which the modulation (sine) will be added.
- Lock-in>Frequency (Hz)	973E+0  #  Sets the frequency of the sine modulation added to the signal to modulate. The frequency range is from 10 mHz to 40 kHz (corresponding to the SC5 output filter cut-off). When working with harmonics, make sure the harmonic frequencies don’t exceed ~100 kHz (SC5 input filter cut-off). Remember the SC5 hardware filters will affect the amplitude when getting close to their cut-off frequencies.
